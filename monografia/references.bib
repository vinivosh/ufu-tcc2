  abstract  = {One of the challenges of high granularity calorimeters, such as that to be built to cover the endcap region in the CMS Phase-2 Upgrade for HL-LHC, is that the large number of channels causes a surge in the computing load when clustering numerous digitized energy deposits (hits) in the reconstruction stage. In this article, we propose a fast and fully parallelizable density-based clustering algorithm, optimized for high-occupancy scenarios, where the number of clusters is much larger than the average number of hits in a cluster. The algorithm uses a grid spatial index for fast querying of neighbors and its timing scales linearly with the number of hits within the range considered. We also show a comparison of the performance on CPU and GPU implementations, demonstrating the power of algorithmic parallelization in the coming era of heterogeneous computing in high-energy physics.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new socioeconomic revolution in which data and immediacy are the main ingredients. IoT generates large datasets on a daily basis but it is currently considered as ``dark data'', i.e., data generated but never analyzed. The efficient analysis of this data is mandatory to create intelligent applications for the next generation of IoT applications that benefits society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are very well suited to identifying hidden patterns and correlations in this data deluge. In particular, clustering algorithms are of the utmost importance for performing exploratory data analysis to identify a set (a.k.a., cluster) of similar objects. Clustering algorithms are computationally heavy workloads and require to be executed on high-performance computing clusters, especially to deal with large datasets. This execution on HPC infrastructures is an energy hungry procedure with additional issues, such as high-latency communications or privacy. Edge computing is a paradigm to enable light-weight computations at the edge of the network that has been proposed recently to solve these issues. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of emergent edge computing architectures that include low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed-up these workloads. Our analysis includes performance and power consumption figures of the latest Nvidia's AGX Xavier to compare the energy-performance ratio of these low-cost platforms with a high-performance cloud-based counterpart version. Three different clustering algorithms (i.e., k-means, Fuzzy Minimals (FM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)) are designed to be optimally executed on edge and cloud platforms, showing a speed-up factor of up to 11$\times$ for the GPU code compared to sequential counterpart versions in the edge platforms and energy savings of up to 150\% between the edge computing and HPC platforms.},

@article{G-DBSCAN,
  abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0, we see a new and differentiated scenario: There is more data than that can be effectively analyzed. Organizing this data has become one of the biggest problems in Computer Science. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, highlighting those related to the Data Mining area, specifically the clustering algorithms. However, these algorithms are still a computational challenge because of the volume of data that needs to be processed. We found in the literature some proposals to make these algorithms feasible, and, recently, those related to parallelization on graphics processing units (GPUs) have presented good results. In this work we present the G-DBSCAN, a GPU parallel version of one of the most widely used clustering algorithms, the DBSCAN. Although there are other parallel versions of this algorithm, our technique distinguishes itself by the simplicity with which the data are indexed, using graphs, allowing various parallelization opportunities to be explored. In our evaluation we show that the G-DBSCAN using GPU, can be over 100x faster than its sequential version using CPU. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2^{b}quanta,b=1,2, \cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

Existing results have been mixed with some studies recommending standardization and others suggesting that it may not be desirable. The existence of numerous approaches to standardization complicates the decision process. The present simulation study examined the standardization problem. A variety of data structures were generated which varied the intercluster spacing and the scales for the variables. The data sets were examined in four different types of error environments. These involved error free data, error perturbed distances, inclusion of outliers, and the addition of random noise dimensions. Recovery of true cluster structure as found by four clustering methods was measured at the correct partition level and at reduced levels of coverage. Results for eight standardization strategies are presented. It was found that those approaches which standardize by division by the range of the variable gave consistently superior recovery of the underlying cluster structure. The result held over different error conditions, separation distances, clustering methods, and coverage levels. The traditionalz-score transformation was found to be less effective in several situations.},

Companies have to consider supplier related risks and threats in their purchasing decisions. In today's competitive and risky business environment, it is very important to work with reliable suppliers. This study proposes a clustering based approach to group suppliers based on their risk profile. Suppliers of a company in the heavy-machinery sector are assessed based on 17 qualitative and quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria are determined by using the Best-Worst method. Four factors are extracted by applying Factor Analysis to the supplier risk data. Then k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group core suppliers of the company based on the four risk factors. Three clusters are created with different risk exposure levels. The interpretation of the results provides insights for risk management actions and supplier development programs to mitigate supplier risk.},

  abstract  = {The availability of high-performance, low-cost microprocessors has removed one of the obstacles to construction of multiprocessor systems which are cost-performance competitive from entry levels through large systems. Advances in understanding of computer structure and focus on multiprocessor design practices has removed the performance bottlenecks associated with multiprocessor systems of the past. Better understanding of multiprocessor scheduling and synchronization in the symmetric Pool Processor Architecture built on the portable base of the UNIX system interface has removed the obstacle to easy application of multiprocessors to single applications. Current research work has produced techniques and tools to facilitate and in some cases automate the decomposition of programs to into parallel execution streams. A computer is described which exploits the removal of these barriers. The Balance 8000 is a multimicrocomputer system based on the National Semiconductor Series 32000 microprocessor. It runs DYNIX, a version of UNIX bsd 4. 2, which exploits the power of from 2 to 12 coordinated microprocessors to achieve a range of performance which approaches the sum of the performance of the individual processors.},
